The continuous research, modifications and advancements resulted in evolution of two subcategories of <b> GTFS feed namely GTF Static and GTFS Realtime </b>. GTFS Static consists of static transit schedule and map data along with the fare information whereas GTFS-realtime includes trip update entity that can be predictive, real-time as well as historic, real-time vehicle location entity along with the service alert entity. This has made GTFS a rich open  source data for transit operation and evaluation and has opened doors for the user community to harness its enormous potential.
